Corruptions or the act of corrupting is taking a video game and breaking it using whatever means necessary, usually with a program called a corruptor. This software can either modify the bytes in a ROM or a game's files to produce unexpected or unusual graphics, gameplay or audio, often resulting in hilarity and or invoking Satan.
